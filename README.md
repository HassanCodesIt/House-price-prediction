# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression to predict house prices based on their sizes. Using Python and the `scikit-learn` library, a linear regression model is trained on sample data and used to make predictions.

## Introduction
This project uses supervised machine learning (linear regression) to predict the price of a house given its size in square feet. It uses a small dataset of house sizes and corresponding prices to train the model.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the `house_price_prediction.py` file and review the code.
2. Run the script to train the model and predict house prices:
    ```bash
    python house_price_prediction.py
    ```

3. Modify the input house size in the script to predict prices for other sizes.

## Example Output
After running the script, you should see output similar to:
```
Predicted price for a 2000 sq. ft. house: 333.25
```
