# House-price-prediction
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression to predict house prices based on their sizes. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, a linear regression model is trained on sample data and used to make predictions.

Introduction
This project uses supervised machine learning (linear regression) to predict the price of a house given its size in square feet. It uses a small dataset of house sizes and corresponding prices to train the model.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd house-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy scikit-learn
Usage
Open the house_price_prediction.py file and review the code.

Run the script to train the model and predict house prices:


python house_price_prediction.py
Modify the input house size in the script to predict prices for other sizes.

Example Output
After running the script, you should see output similar to:


Predicted price for a 2000 sq. ft. house: 333.25
